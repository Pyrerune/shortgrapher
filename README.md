# Item Shortage Graph
- This is a mod I designed to show easier to understand production stats.
- It pretty much just shows the difference between produced and consumed resources.
- I'm not sure if anybody would have a use for this other than me but I've published it anyways.

## Settings
- By default it only shows items with negative values.  You can change that in the mod settings
- SHIFT+P is the default key to open the GUI
- You can also change how many ticks it takes to update the GUI.

## Disclaimer
- While there is a github for this mod.  It is my first mod so the source code is a total mess.
### Here there be dragons
